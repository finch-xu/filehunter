# Locations — each [[locations]] maps a URL prefix to search paths.
#
# Search mode per location: "sequential" (default), "concurrent", or "latest_modified".
#   sequential      — check roots one-by-one in config order; first match wins.
#   concurrent      — probe all eligible roots at the same time; fastest match wins,
#                     remaining searches are cancelled immediately.
#   latest_modified — check all roots and return the file with the most recent
#                     modification time.
#
# Each location has its own paths with optional extensions filter.
# If extensions is omitted or empty, all file types are allowed.
# Requests that don't match any location prefix return 404.

# Example: single catch-all location (simplest setup)
